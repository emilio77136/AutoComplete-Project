	Trie AutoComplete System

	A Trie based autocomplete system works by organizing words
where each level represents a character. One of the main strenghts
of this design is that the time needed to insert a word, search for	
a word, remove a word, or look up a prefix depends only on the numbers
of letters in the prefix. The size of the entire dictionary does not
affect those actions. This gives the autocomplete system consistently
fast performance, which is important for real time typing and search
features.
	Testing autocomplete is straight foward this this structure 
because every actions work the same way. The system follows each letter
of the input one step at a time. This makes it easy to see how the
system reacts during tests. For example, testers can check how fast
suggestions appear, how the system behaves with short or long prefixes,
and what happens when a prefix dosent match anything. If the prefix exists
in the Trie, the system goes into a branch that holds all related words.
If it dosent the result is simply an empty list. The behavior is consistent
so it is easy to test accuracy, speed and error handling. 
	Inserting, searching and deleting can also be tested separately
because each operation depends on the same logic. Patters such as shared 
prefixes, long worrds or group of related words can be used to observe
system behavior under different conditions. This includes how shared branches are reused, how many suggestions appear under certain nodes and
how many suggestions appear under certain nodes. The predictable structure
makes it easier to analyze performance and correctness during experiments.
	Although efficient, this design also has some limits. Every node 
stores an array of 26 pointers, one for each lowercase lette, even though
most of these remain empty. This increases the memory usage. The system 
also works only with lowercase letters because it uses fixed postions from
0 to 25 for character indexing. Another limitation is that suggestions depend
strictly on matching the beginning of the word. If the user types the first
letter incorrectly the system cannot offer the autocomplete task.
	Despite these drawbacks, the Trie offers fast lookups and clear
prefix organization. These qualities make it a strong and dependable structure
for autocomplete systems that requiere quick and accurate word suggestions.
